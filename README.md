# First-Repo.-Hello-World
My first Steps in Learning how Git Hub Works.

I am interested in Learning How I oprate.Basically this is my first time creating a github account, with the aim of Documenting staff.
I was Challenged by Chrispine Tinega during my previous day visit to His place on getting to Document everything that I do.
I fing this process engaging and fulfilling, Since I am in the process of remoulding and reshaping myself.
I look forward to being transparent and resourceful in all matters.
I am lerning not getting angry fast, and also trying being productive.

I am Curious to learn.. and Dsign Staff..
